# Welcome to BakeAcademy Project (C23-PR538)
Have you heard this phrase? _Belum kenyang kalau
belum makan nasi_
## Project Background
Indonesia is a country with diverse cultural heritages and a variety of traditional cuisines. Although rice is our primary source of carbs, we lack knowledge on how to make other types of carbs, such as bread. Even though some regional specialities have bread on them, bread is generally considered a sweet treat rather than a staple carb source.

We want to introduce a wide range of bakery goods and teach people how to make them through BakeAcademy.<br>
Additionally, the app can serve as a warning for users who are allergic to certain ingredients by displaying the food ingredients and showing its nutritional value.
