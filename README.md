Have you heard this phrase? _Belum kenyang kalau
belum makan nasi_
## Project Background
Indonesia is a country with diverse cultural heritages and a variety of traditional cuisines. Although rice is our primary source of carbs, we lack knowledge on how to make other types of carbs, such as bread. Even though some regional specialities have bread on them, bread is generally considered a sweet treat rather than a staple carb source.
